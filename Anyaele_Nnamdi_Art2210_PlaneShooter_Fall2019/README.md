# Final Designer Statement

I wanted to really push my creativity for my final project.  I feel that I was not putting enough art into my other projects this semester.  I mainly focused on the technological side of programming, with know thought as to how I would integrate the programming I have learned into the type of art I enjoy doing.  

That is why I have decided to really try to emphasize animation for my final.   Animation is where my strongest passion resides, so I did not really have a problem putting effort into that area.  It was a bit difficult combing through the P5 and P5.Play libraries to find the right ways to get my game to do what I wanted it to do.  My greatest inspiration for this particular project is Cuphead.  Cuphead is a side scrolling 2d game in the shoot-‘em-up genre. I feel that Cuphead perfectly mixes together the art of animation with game development.  

 My game is modeled after the same genre.  I also took the liberty to create all of the animations in my project in the frame by frame style Cuphead is known for.  I used the Play library from P5 to handle the sprite animations.  I was able to animate in Opentoonz, a free 2D animation software previously used by Studio Ghibli.  From there I created simple animations for my sprites.  One thing very helpful about Opentoonz is that there is a setting to automatically export sprite sheets.  The sprite sheet contains all of the frames in a given animation in one image.  This is a great method for saving space, and is pretty common in the game development world.

The hardest part for me was not coding by itself.  But it was solving the various problems that stood in the way of me achieving my vision for the game.  P5 has tons of documentation.  P5.Play has some as well, though not as much.  Still, no matter ow much documentation there is, if you want to make something unique that will require you to design your own algorithms and put the code together like a puzzle custom made just for you.
