Jean-Michel Basquiat is the artist whose works I decided to base my HTML page on.  First, I would like to get into a little history about the artist.   

Jean-Michel Basquiat was a famous African American pop artist who rose to prominence around the later part of the 90s.  He was born to a Haitian father and Puerto Rican mother in Brooklyn, New York.  Commonly referred to simply as *Basquiat*, he grew up as a child with many talents, but became known for his graffiti art work around New York City.  He eventually elevated n popularity to the point where he was inducted into Andy Warhol’s inner circle of artists. 


Basquiat’s art is known for its very loose, sketchy, and almost primitive rendering.  They are very tactile, and have a very whimsical, yet dark and melancholic quality to them.  His works also frequently incorporates themes from popular culture, hip hop culture, and heavy influence from the African diaspora.  His works are also steeped in political messages, though this may be hard to recognize in many of is scribbly art pieces.  Basquiat’s work has been described as child-like in a way.  By this it I mean, he is able to strip away the much of what he knows about the visual representation of how we see the world around us, and render it on canvas as a child might do it. In doing this, his work is usually, simple, yet complicated, plain, yet random and chaotic, not unlike Picasso.  He also employees a very visceral use of colors in ways that I cannot fully understand. 


I thought that this would be a fitting challenge for me to take on. I wanted to attempt to capture his whimsical, and childlike style in code, as best as I possibly could.  Basquiat’s style is extremely loose, free flowing, and organic.  These are qualities that would be difficult to reproduce with P5’s blocky and controlled digital graphics.  One of the pieces I took the most inspiration from is Basquiat’s XXL.
